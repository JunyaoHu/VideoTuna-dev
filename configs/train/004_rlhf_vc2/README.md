# Reward Based Alignment

We follow VADER to use "hpsv2" as aesthetic reward model to finetune. 

# VideoTuna Support 

// environment configuration follow official RADER 

## Train VADER with VideoTuna

```shell
bash configs/configs/train/004_rlhf_vc2/run.sh
```

## Inference VADER with VideoTuna

```
bash configs/configs/train/004_rlhf_vc2/inference.sh
```

## Implementation Illustration
